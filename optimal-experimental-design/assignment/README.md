# Experimental Design Assignment

This assignment is designed to show how to use Bayesian Optimization to solve a molecular modeling challenge. 
It assumes you are comfortable with:

- Training machine learning models using Scikit-Learn
- Working with arrays of data using Pandas
- Developing for loops in Python. This assignment is more coding-heavy than others

It is designed to teach you how to use active learning with enumerable and non-enumerable search spaces (i.e., where you must use conventional global optimizers in conjuntion with Bayesian optimization).
