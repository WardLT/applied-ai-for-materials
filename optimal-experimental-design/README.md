# Optimal Experimental Design

Optimal Experimental Design methods help you design experiments as you perform them by recommending
which experiments will be the most valuable given previous results.
These notebooks introduce the fundamentals and tools used to perform optimizations.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for this module are:

- Explaining the purpose and design of acquistion functions. *How can I vary degree of exploration with Upper Confidence Bound?*
- Identifying the best types of algorithms for different problems. *What approach should I choose for a high-throughput experiments?*
- Developing experiments to test active learning systems. *What do I use as a baseline?*
