# Bayesian Statistics for Physics Models

Bayesian Methods offer a statistically-robust route to assessing how confident one should be in the predictions of a machine learning model.
Knowing how to work with Bayesian methods is a excellent when you have small amounts of data, a good sense of the model which could describe your data,
or need for meaningful error bars on the properties.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for our model are:

- Learning how to define the prior and likelihood functions. *How do you include the model form in the likehood function?*
- Understanding MCMC sampling. *What is burn-in and how do I achieve it?*
- Comparing the evidence for different models. *What is a Bayes factor and what is a large Bayes factor?*
- Using the posterior to estimate error bars on predictions. *Can you produce a 95% confidence interval?*
