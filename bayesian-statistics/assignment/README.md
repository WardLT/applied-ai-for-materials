# Bayesian Parameter Estimation Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to estimate the parameters of a model using Monte Carlo sampling.

You will need to know how to:

- [ ] Create and use [probability distribution tools from Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#continuous-distributions)
- [ ] The basics of [Bayesian statistics](../0_simple-bayesian-estimation.ipynb)
- [ ] Perform posterior sampling using [Kombine](../1_model-comparison-with-kombine.ipynb)

As you complete this assignment, you will learn how to estimate parameters more multiple models using data collected by different experiemnts
and how to estimate parameters in data with outliers.
